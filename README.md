# Wrestling_Match_Simulation
Simplified simulation of a match between two high school wrestling teams
Two teams are created containing 13 weight classes in which a randomly generated number of athletes are assigned. Each athlete’s weight determination is based on probability data of their respective and randomly generated age group. They are then assigned a randomly generated ability score and a probability of performance for a match.
Individual team weight classes are then pitted against each other in which the two player’s with the highest ability scores ‘wrestle’. Their respective probability of performance for that match is compared and a winner is determined. The points which the team receives is based on how large the performance gap is.
Total team scores are tracked until the end, and a winner is declared.
